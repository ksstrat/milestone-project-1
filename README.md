# **Kayak Community Page**
## **Site Overview**
WaterWayFriends is an open kayak community always on the lookout for new members and friends. The goal of the community is to bring kayak enthusiasts together and inspire new people to get excited about kayaking.
The community regularly organizes tours that focus on shared experiences. You can register for these tours on the website. Interested individuals can get an impression from pictures of past tours and testimonials from previous participants.
Additionally, the benefits of kayaking are highlighted, such as the experience of nature, its relaxing and almost meditative effect, as well as the physical training and the thrill of adventure.

## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
* Users who are looking for a new sport that is both relaxing and challenging.
* Users who have had their first contact with kayaking and want to learn more about it.
* Users who already kayak regularly and are now looking for a group to join for shared tours.
* Users who are already members of the WaterWayFriends community and want to stay informed about upcoming tours.

### **User Stories:**
* As a User, I want to find information quickly and efficiently without frustration.
* As a User, I need easy navigation, including a responsive layout for my device.
* As a User, I want to see high-quality images of past tours.
* As a User, I want to find contact details and social media links easily.
* As a user, I want to see upcoming tours and potential costs.
* As a User, I want to book a kayak tour.
* As a user, I want to read the opinions of participants.

### **Site Aims:**
* To show what the WaterWayFriends community is all about.
* To educate the user on the benefits of kayaking.
* To give the user the opportunity to become part of a community of kayak enthusiasts.
* To provide users with information about past tours, such as pictures and testimonials.
* To provide the user with information about upcoming tours and allow the User to make a booking.

### **How Is This Will Be Achieved:**
* The home page provides the user with information about kayaking and kayaking tours.
* The site will show the user high quality images of past tours.
* The site will explain the benefits of kayaking to the user.
* The site will provide users with opinions from participants of past tours.
* The site will show the user the upcoming tours. It will also provide detailed information about the tours.
* The site will allow the user to book one of the upcoming tours.
* The site will allow the user to become part of the WayWaterFriends Community.

### **Wireframes:**
I created wireframes for this project to organise my ideas and not lose focus. See the links below for the mobile and desktop versions of the four wireframes.

* Mobile Wireframes:
    * [Home page]
    * [Tours page]
    * [Booking page]
    * [Success page]

* Desktop wireframes:
    * [Home page]
    * [Tours page]
    * [Booking page]
    * [Success page]

### **Color Scheme:**
When choosing the colour scheme, I wanted a scheme that represented the element of water, while providing enough contrast for good readability. To generate the color palette I used https://coolors.co/. 
I chose a variaton of light blue as the primary colour and a variation of white as the background colour.
A test with Lighthouse then showed that this choice of color was not optimal from an accessibility perspective. I had to change the light blue I had originally planned to a much darker blue.
In the end, this was the better decision as it gave the site a much more elegant design.
